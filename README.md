Zen C++ Libraries
=================

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenCPP/Zen/master/zen-logo.png" height="250" />

The Zen C++ libraries are a set of C++ headers that you can freely use in your
own projects. The libraries try to fill missing pieces in the existing C++
ecosystem, based on ideas taken from Haskell and Rust.

ðŸ§ª These headers are experimental and currently require a modern compiler
supporting a modern C++ standard.

## Installation and Usage 

Currently, the preferred method for using these libraries is by downloading a
recent tarball of the repository's source and checking in the sources into your
project's version control system (e.g. in a folder called `vendor/zen`).

**CMakeLists.txt**
```cmake
add_subdirectory(vendor/zen EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# ...

target_link_libraries(myapp zen_base)

```

Additionally, we are working on a system that will automatically detect,
download and build the correct dependencies without pulling in CMake. However, 
the construction of this build tool will take a while.

## Documentation

Documentation will soon be available on [the official website][1]. For now, you
will have to consult the header files in `include/zen/` to learn more.
Alternatively, you can try to build the documentation locally using [Doxygen][2].

## Coding standard

We try to mimick the C++ standard library coding conventions as much as
possible, in the same way the Boost project does.

 - All identifiers are written in `snake_case`, unless it is a template
   parameter. Template parameters are always written in `CamelCase`.
 - When there is potential confusion about whether a source object is a type, a
   function or something else, we append the `_t` suffix to the name.
 - Functions that construct a certain type are prefixed with `make_`, e.g.
   `make_program` or `make_cloned`.

As a general rule of thumb, the code should be compatible with the standard
library and be as clear as possible.
