Zen C++ Libraries
=================

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenLibraries/ZenLibraries/master/zen-logo.png" height="250" />

The Zen C++ libraries are a set of C++ headers that aim to partially replace
the C++ standard library. The libraries try to fill missing pieces in the
existing C++ ecosystem, based on ideas taken from Haskell and Rust.

You can freely use these libraries in your own projects. 

‚ö†Ô∏èüß™ These libraries are experimental. They require a modern C++ compiler that
supports at least C++17. The API may break regularly with the release of new
versions. If you plan to make use of them right now, you will have to refactor
your code regularly when upgrading.

## Installation and Usage 

We support Meson and CMake. Currently, the preferred method for using these
libraries is by downloading a recent tarball of the repository's source and
checking in the sources into your project's version control system.

**It is highly recommended to define a custom Zen++ namespace.** Doing so will
avoid conflicts with dependencies that use a different version of these
libraries. For instance, if your project has a namespace `myapp`, you would
define the Zen namespace as `myapp::zen`.

Meson is the recommended choice for setting up your project. Download a tarball
of this repository and drop the contents in `subprojects/zen`. Next, adjust the
following example to match your project setup.

**meson.build**
```meson
project('myproject', 'cxx')

zen_proj = subproject('zen', default_options: ['namespace=myapp::zen'])
zen_dep = zen_proj.get_variable('zen_dep')

executable('myapp', dependencies: zen_dep)
```

CMake is also supported, although we really recommend using Meson. CMake does
not play nice with in-source subprojects because there's no elegant way to
emulate Meson's `default_options`. Until we have figured out how to do it
properly, you might want to use the following.

**CMakeLists.txt**
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

project(MyApp CXX)

# This will overwrite any value that might previously have been set.
set(ZEN_NAMESPACE myapp::zen CACHE INTERNAL "The Zen++ namespace this project will use" FORCE)

add_subdirectory(third_party/zen EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

add_executable(myapp src/main.cc)

target_link_libraries(myapp zen)
```

## Documentation

Documentation will soon be available on [the official website][1]. For now, you
will have to consult the header files in `zen/` to learn more.
Alternatively, you can try to build the documentation locally using [Doxygen][2].
