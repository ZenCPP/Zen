Zen C++ Libraries
=================

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenLibraries/ZenLibraries/master/zen-logo.png" height="250" />

The Zen C++ libraries are a set of C++ headers and sources that aim to replace
the C++ standard library. The libraries try to fill missing pieces in the
existing C++ ecosystem, based on ideas taken from Haskell and Rust. In the
future, it might even be possible to use the headers without any runtime
dependency on the C++ standard library.

‚ö†Ô∏èüß™ These libraries are experimental. They require a modern C++ compiler that
supports at least C++17. The API may break regularly with the release of new
versions. If you plan to make use of them right now, expect to refactor your
code regularly.

### What are the advantages?

You may consider Zen++ a standard library that isn't limited by the requirement
of being backwards-compatible. Zen++ designed to be lightweight, fast and
feature-complete, but without a stable ABI. This allows us to move faster than
the STL is able to and fix inconsistencies much more easily. It's your job to keep in
sync.

### What are the drawbacks?

 - _New updates might need a small refactor of your code._ For example, a
   better `Maybe<T>` might require you to use strucutred binding declarations
   instead of using the dereferce operator. Only use this library if your team
   has enough bandwidth to keep in sync.
 - _No support for exceptions._ The libraries use `Either<L, R>` to encode
   exceptions in the return type instead of throwing them. Moreover, if Zen++
   is used as a replacement of the standard library, `-fno-exceptions` or
   something equivalent is required.
 - _No RTTI support._ For performance reasons, all polymorphic information in
   this library is encoded using enums or something similar. Moreover, if Zen++
   is used as a replacement of the standard library, `-fno-rtti` or something
   equivalent must be added to your compiler flags.

Use this library only if you feel like these drawbacks are justified for the
project you're working on.

## Installation and Usage 

We support Meson and CMake. Currently, the preferred method for using these
libraries is by downloading a recent tarball of the repository's source and
checking in the sources into your project's version control system.

**If you're building a library that uses Zen++ internally, it is highly
recommended to define a custom Zen++ namespace.** Doing so will avoid conflicts
with dependencies that use a different version of these libraries. For
instance, if your project has a namespace `mylib`, you would define the Zen
namespace as `mylib::zen`.

Meson is the recommended choice for setting up your project. Download a tarball
of this repository and drop the contents in `subprojects/zen`. Next, adjust the
following example to match your project setup.

**meson.build**
```meson
project('myproject', 'cxx')

zen_proj = subproject('zen', default_options: ['namespace=mylib::zen'])
zen_dep = zen_proj.get_variable('zen_dep')

library('mylib', dependencies: zen_dep)
```

CMake is also supported, although we really recommend using Meson. CMake does
not play nice with in-source subprojects because there's no elegant way to
emulate Meson's `default_options`. Until we have figured out how to do it
properly, you might want to use the following.

**CMakeLists.txt**
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

project(MyProject CXX)

# This will overwrite any value that might previously have been set.
set(ZEN_NAMESPACE mylib::zen CACHE INTERNAL "The Zen++ namespace this project will use" FORCE)

add_subdirectory(third_party/zen EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

add_library(mylib src/main.cc)

target_link_libraries(mylib zen)
```

## Documentation

Documentation will soon be available on [the official website][1]. For now, you
will have to consult the header files in `zen/` to learn more.
Alternatively, you can try to build the documentation locally using [Doxygen][2].
