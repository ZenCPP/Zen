Zen C++ Libraries
=================

The Zen C++ libraries are a set of C++ headers that you can freely use in your
own projects. The libraries try to fill missing pieces in the existing C++
ecosystem, based on ideas taken from Haskell and Rust.

ðŸ§ª These headers are experimental and currently require a modern compiler
supporting a modern C++ standard.

## Examples

Say we have the following types defined:

```cpp
class Shape {

  virtual ~Shape() {};

  // ...

};

class Rect : public Shape {

  Rect(std::size_t width, std::size_t height);

  ~Shape() {  }

   // ...

};

class Triangle : public Shape {

  Triangle(std::size_t side1, std::size_t side2, std::size_t side3);

  ~Triangle() {  }

  // ...

};
```

The `zen::ValuePtr`-type allows you to pass arbitrary values between different functions by-value.

```cpp
zen::ValuePtr<Shape> my_shape = zen::make_value_ptr<Rect>(4, 6);
```

The pattern matching facilities allow you to very efficiently check the kind of object you're holding:

```cpp
Match (*my_shape) {
  Case (C<Rect>()) {
    std::cerr << "I am holding a rectangle!" << std::endl;
    break;
  }
  Case (C<Triangle>()) {
    std::cerr << "I am holding a triangle!" << std::endl;
    break;
  }
}
```

Using the `zen::Either`-type, we can safely express computations that can fail:

```cpp
enum class MyError {
  SomeCheckHasFailed,
}

template<typename T>
using MyResult = zen::Either<MyError, T>;

MyResult<int> computation_that_may_fail() {
  if (some_check_that_may_fail) {
    return zen::left(MyError::SomeCheckHasFailed);
  }
  return zen::right(42);
}
```

Combining these facilities, we can write some very powerful code:

```cpp
MyResult<zen::ValuePtr<Shape>> another_computation_that_may_fail() {
  Match (computation_that_may_fail()) {
    Case (C<zen::Left>(error))
      return zen::make_left(error);
    Case (C<zen::Right>(result)) {
      return zen::make_right(zen::make_value_ptr<Rect>(result, result * 2));
    }
  }
}

```

## Installation and Usage 

Currently, the preferred method for using these libraries is by downloading a
release tarball and checking in the sources into your project (e.g. in a folder
called `third_party/zen`).

## Coding standard

We try to adhere to the [C++ Core Guidelines][1], which are recommended by the
Standard C++ Foundation. As a rule of thumb, we use the following conventions:

 - Functions are written in snake-case.
 - Library types have their first letter capitalised to distinguish them from
   the standard library types.
 - Indentation is consistently 2 spaces over the entire code base.

## API Reference

### zen::Either<L, K>

`#include "zen/either.hpp"`

A type that produce one of two results depending on the given input.

A common idiom is to use this type on functions that can fail, instead of
exception handling. This is recommended for a few reasons:

 - Absence of `throw`-statements allows compilers to better reason
   about your program, possibly resulting in faster code.
 - Consumers of your API know immediately that a function might fail, and have to 
   deal with it explicitly.
 - Because the exception type is encoded in the type, some bugs can be captured at
   compile-time.

```cpp
zen::Either<std::string, int> send_notification(std::string msg) {
  // ...
  if (status == E_QUEUE_FULL) {
    return zen::left("Could not send message: the queue is full.")
  }
  return right(...)
}
```

### zen::left(T val)

`#include "zen/either.hpp"`

Construct an `Either`-object with its left-hand-side initialized to the given value.

### zen::right(T val)

`#include "zen/either.hpp"`

Construct an `Either`-object with its right-hand-side initialized to the given value.
